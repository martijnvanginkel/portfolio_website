                    Weurd is my first project in Javascript. I built this interactive translation application not only to learn Javascript and NodeJS, but also to help my girlfriend as she learns to speak Dutch. In Weurd, you can create, edit, and delete custom lists of words. Users are able to test their knowledge by playing a list. While playing, words appear on the screen and the user gives the correct translation of a word. If an incorrect translation is entered, the correct answer appears briefly (to help correct the userâ€™s understanding) and will be reshuffled into the list so the user has another opportunity to accurately learn the word.<br><br>
                    Through building this application, I learned how to use Express, a lightweight backend framework, and Mongo DB, a no SQL database. Additionally, I built a small API in order to conduct fetch calls from the front end. I really enjoyed creating this project and I am enthusiastic to continue to use Javascript for future projects!
