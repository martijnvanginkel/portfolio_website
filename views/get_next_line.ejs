                <p class="project_text">Get Next Line is an assignment I made at Codam (an Amsterdam-based programming school). It was one of the first programs I made using C and it taught me the fundamentals of the language. I was assigned to make a program that could read text from files, line by line. By looping the function the program would result in being able to read entire files. The assignment restricted the amount of lines I could use and therefore it forced me to write clean and efficient code.</p>
